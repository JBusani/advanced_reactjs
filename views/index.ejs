<!-- We used to have loading... in the root div. But 
now we have something else. THe goal was to server side render
react in case javascript is disabled. if the server has a copy of react
then the browser has it and won't need to make another 

React will compute the difference between server and client. so it
is actually sensitive to spaces. Don't leave the spaces.-->
